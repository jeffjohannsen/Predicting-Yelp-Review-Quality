# Outline and Action Plan

* Getting the Data
    * Locating Data Sources
    * Setting Data Collection Methods and Code
    * Bringing in the Data and Data Storage

* Questions and Goals
* Model Selection and Optimization
    * Supervised Learning Model
    * Unsupervised Learning Model
    * Cost Metric Selection
    * How the models were fit and Why they were fit this way.
    * Cross Validation
* Conclusions
* Readme
    * Creation
    * Organization
    * Proof-reading and clean-up
* Code
    * Organization
    * Functions and Pipeline Class
    * Docstrings
    * Proofing with pycodestyle
* Github Repo
    * Organization
    * Proofing and clean-up
* Presentation
    * Outline and Flow that fits timeframe
    * Practice Read-throughs
    * Utilize Public Speaking Template


## Reminders
* Focus on MVP. Create Pipeline of classes and functions that automate as much of the above Action Plan as possible.
* Don't get stuck in data acquisition. Need to have a backup plan if data collection isn't going well enough.
* Spend most of my class time focused on value add work like README additions and improvements and python coding. Research can be focused on during off time if I'm still interested.
* Remember to save time (At least 1 full day) for smoothing out the final project. README touch ups, presentation outline and practice, pycodestyle review, Github repo clean up and organization, etc.
