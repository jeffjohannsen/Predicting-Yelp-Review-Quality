# Project Goals

### Primary Goal 

* Create a prediction system that evaluates the quality (usefulness to user) of a review at the time the review is created.

### Secondary Goals

* Do a deeper dive into Yelp data analysis to locate more interesting questions and projects.
* Create a recommendation system to showcase the highest quality reviews to users.
* Deep dive into NLP to learn more advanced skills and tools.
* Deep dive into deep learning to add a level of knowledge in this area.
* Create a starting point and connection point for moving into Bizy project.

## Central Questions

1. Can the quality of a Yelp review be predicted at a level that is worthwhile to implemented within the broader process?
2. What factors contribute most to the quality of a Yelp review?
